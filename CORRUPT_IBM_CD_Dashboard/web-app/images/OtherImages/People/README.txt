People icons are used when a person's photo is loading or if no photo is
supplied by the person or group. These images are provided in both PNG
and JPG format.  Use the PNG format if you are including the image in a
CSS sprite.  Use the JPG format if you are returning the image through
an API (such as a directory server) that expects all pictures to be
transmitted in JPG format.
