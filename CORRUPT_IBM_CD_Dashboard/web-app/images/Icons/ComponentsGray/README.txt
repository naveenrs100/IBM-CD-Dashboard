Component icons are used to launch a component and appear in the
applications dropdown menu.  These icons can appear with the name
of the component or without.

Some 16 pixel images are provided in ICO format (in addition to PNG format)
for use as favicons.  The previews of the images in ICO format may
not display in all browsers.
