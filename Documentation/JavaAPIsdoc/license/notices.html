transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent 
claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily 
infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their 
Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was 
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity 
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that 
the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work 
constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent 
licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall 
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies 
of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or

Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent 
notices stating that You changed the files; and<br>

notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and<br>
<br>
(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of 
its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute 
must include a readable copy of the attribution notices 
contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do 
not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least 
one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file 
distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or 
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a 
display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such 
third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE 
file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the 
NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional 
attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.<br>
<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your 
use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise 
complies with the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state 
otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in 
the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and

have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
<br>
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to 
use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product 
names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and 
customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing 
the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable 
law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and 
each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" 
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either 
express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties 
or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for 
determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and 
assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions 
under this License.<br>
<br>
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal 
theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>
<br>
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While 
redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.<br>

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active

ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a

version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". 
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is 
written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment

<br>
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your 
modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and 
conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your 
modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your

theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or 
otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and 
grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any 
Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, 
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or 
inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for 
loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or 
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages.<br>

redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to 
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, 
indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent 
with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You 
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole 
responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You 
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless 
for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional

with that tool.  Shrinksafe contains modified files from Mozilla 
Rhino covered under Mozilla Public License Version 1.1.  The 
source code for these modifications has been made available at the 
public Dojo svn repository at http://www.dojotoolkit.org.<br>
<br>
The Shrinksafe tool requires use of Mozilla Rhino 1.6r7 or 
higher in order to run.  We are relying on the separate DD 
Checklist already approved for the Rhino 1.7R2 jar. The version of 
Rhino that will be redistributed with the Shrinksafe package by 
default is the approved version of Mozilla Rhino 1.7r2.<br>

GNU Lesser General Public License<br>
Version 2.1, February 1999<br>
Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 
Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is 
permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It 
also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, 
version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]<br>
Preamble<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away 
your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU 
General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to 
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free 
for all its users.<br>
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to 
some specially designated software packages--typically 
libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who 
decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first 
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary 
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any 
particular case, based on the explanations below.<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom 
of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to 
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free 
software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive 
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the 
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are 
informed that you can do these things.<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that 
forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to 
surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain 
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you 
modify it.<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, 
whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the 
rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, 
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the 
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, 
so that they can relink them with the library after making 
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them 
these terms so they know their rights.<br>
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we 
copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives 
you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the 
library.<br>
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear 
that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the 
library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients 
should know that what they have is not the original version, so 
that the original author's reputation will not be affected by 
problems that might be introduced by others.<br>
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the 
existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company 
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by 
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we 
insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the 
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified 
in this license.<br>
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by 
the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU 
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated 
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public 
License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to 
permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.<br>
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically 
or using a shared library, the combination of the two is 
legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original 
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such 
linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of 
freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria 
for linking other code with the library.<br>
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License 
because it does Less to protect the user's freedom than the 
ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free 
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free 
programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary 
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser 
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.<br>
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need 
to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so 
that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free 
programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is 
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free 
libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free 
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public 
License.<br>
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in 
non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a 
large body of free software. For example, permission to use the 
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to 
use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the 
GNU/Linux operating system.<br>
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less 
protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a 
program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the 
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution 
and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference 
between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the 
library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas 
the latter must be combined with the library in order to run.<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND 
MODIFICATION<br>
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library 
or other program which contains a notice placed by the 
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be 
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also 
called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or 
data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application 
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form 
executables.<br>
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library 
or work which has been distributed under these terms. A "work 
based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative 
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the 
Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications 
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. 
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
"modification".)<br>
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the 
work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete 
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, 
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts 
used to control compilation and installation of the library.<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and 
modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its 
scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not 
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its 
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the 
use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is 
true depends on what the Library does and what the program that 
uses the Library does.<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the 
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to 
the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this 
License along with the Library.<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a 
copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in 
exchange for a fee.<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any 
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy 
and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of 
Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these 
conditions:<br>
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.<br>
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent 
notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any 
change.<br>
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at 
no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br>
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a 
function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program 
that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when 
the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort 
to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply 
such function or table, the facility still operates, and 
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.<br>
(For example, a function in a library to compute square 
roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of 
the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be 
optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root 
function must still compute square roots.)<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. 
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the 
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate 
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not 
apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a 
whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of 
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose 
permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to 
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights 
or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; 
rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on 
the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the 
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not 
bring the other work under the scope of this License.<br>
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU 
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of 
the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that 
refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU 
General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If 
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General 
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version 
instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.<br>
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is 
irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License 
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from 
that copy.<br>
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the 
code of the Library into a program that is not a library.<br>
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 
2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.<br>
If distribution of object code is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent 
access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the 
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties 
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of 
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being 
compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the 
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the 
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.<br>
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the 
Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library 
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work 
that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by 
this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such 
executables.<br>
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a 
header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the 
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the 
source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant 
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work 
is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not 
precisely defined by law.<br>
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a 
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus 
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)<br>
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you 
may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of 
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under 
Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library 
itself.<br>
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also 
combine or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to 
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute 
that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms 
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and 
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.<br>
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work 
that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use 
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this 
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, 
you must include the copyright notice for the Library among 
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of 
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:<br>
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that 
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that 
the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a 
modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is 
understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files 
in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the 
application to use the modified definitions.)<br>
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with 
the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run 
time a copy of the library already present on the user's 
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the 
executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of 
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified 
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was 
made with.<br>
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at 
least three years, to give the same user the materials specified 
in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 
performing this distribution.<br>
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access 
to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to 
copy the above specified materials from the same place.<br>
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of 
these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.<br>
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses 
the Library" must include any data and utility programs needed 
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special 
exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything 
that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) 
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component 
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 
use both them and the Library together in an executable that 
you distribute.<br>
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based 
on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with 
other library facilities not covered by this License, and 
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate 
distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library 
facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two 
things:<br>
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same 
work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 
facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections 
above.<br>
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the 
fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and 
explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same 
work.<br>
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 
distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this 
License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link 
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically 
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
full compliance.<br>
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you 
have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. 
These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this 
License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any 
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this 
License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.<br>
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work 
based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a 
license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with 
or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' 
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for 
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation 
of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to 
patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court 
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent 
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at 
all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty- 
free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive 
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain 
entirely from distribution of the Library.<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or 
unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the 
section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is 
intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to 
infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest 
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of 
protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system 
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people 
have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application 
of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he 
or she is willing to distribute software through any other 
system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is 
believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is 
restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted 
interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under 
this License may add an explicit geographical distribution 
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is 
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, 
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the 
body of this License.<br>
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or 
new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to 
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or 
concerns.<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If 
the Library specifies a version number of this License which 
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of 
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any 
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose 
any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into 
other free programs whose distribution conditions are 
incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For 
software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write 
to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions 
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of 
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and 
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE 
IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT 
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND 
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY 
AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY 
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED 
TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY 
WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED 
ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE 
OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO 
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO 
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries<br>
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the 
greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free 
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by 
permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under 
the terms of the ordinary General Public License).<br>
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the 
library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and 
each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a 
pointer to where the full notice is found. <br>

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active 
on December 31 2002. This version removes the copyright 
ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials 
other than those owned by the W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a 
host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated 
version of the license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". 
Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous version and is 
written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment 
of GPL compatibility and OSI's certification under the Open
