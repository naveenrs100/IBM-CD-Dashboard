These images are for media players/viewers.

According to the bidirectional language competency center, right-to-left
languages such as Hebrew and Arabic do not need mirrored versions of standard
play, stop, pause, rewind, fast-forward, etc. icons.  Media player software
should match the icons used on physical devices.  The icons on the devices
were originally derived from the direction of the physical tape movement and
manufacturers do not develop alternate devices for markets where right-to-left
languages are used.

However, arrow icons used to indicate scrolling, should match the direction in
which the scroll behavior is implemented.  Scrolling should be consistent with
other mirrored scrolling behavior in the user interface.
