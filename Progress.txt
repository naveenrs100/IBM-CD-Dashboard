			Needed to assign Enterprise Developer licence to my user as per - https://jazz.net/forum/questions/95134/unable-to-create-jke-in-401

		Sample Project installed
		(((/Images/Installing Sample Project.jpg)))

		Sample JKE Project has no data in it, need to drop and recreate.
		Added lib dependencies to grails app.
		
		RTC Server appears to start in the logs, sometimes it is accessible from the weblink, sometimes not. Server requests 4GB of memory at startup laptop currently only has 4GB or RAM memory installed (Will upgrade), changed 
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xmx4G"
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms4G"
		in server.startup file to
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xmx2G"
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms2G"
		This has no effect, the server still will not startup. - Big Roadblock - emailed Brendan.

Week Beginning 19/11/13
	Ordered additional (16GB) RAM for laptop

	Uninstalled Jenkins - uses a lot of RAM in the background even with no jobs.

	Uninstalled RTC Server and reinstalled. Working fine now, waiting for RAM to arrive before attempting to install the sample project.

	Working with Site Template - Added Title and Nav bar components as per the IBM OneUI Template. Linked in CSS files and file structure - CSS not being utilised.

	Installed RTC Server on desktop computer on home network. Installed Sample Projects, Error, but looks as if all is there, will suffice until additional RAM arrives and can install locally on virtualbox. Can access this now through my local network at home.

Week Beginning 27/11/13
	
	Connecting to JTS I get:
		Error 500: Internal Server Error
		URI
		/IBM_CD_Dashboard/rtcTest/index
		Class
		org.xml.sax.SAXParseException
		Message
		The reference to entity "etag" must end with the ';' delimiter.
	Seems to be related to basic and form authentication

	Changing Tomcat authentication from FORM to BASIC as per - https://jazz.net/forum/questions/100510/jazz-authentication-change-from-form-to-basic-on-tomacat

	Form returned with 200 success code now.

	Printing the returned XML from /ccm/oslc/workitems/catalog to screen produces one string "Project Areas" - need to install sample project JKE Banking on Virtual Machine JTS Server.

	Installing the JKE Banking sample - Error.
		Licence issue.
		Assigned Rational Quality Manager - Quality Professional, Rational Requirements Composer - Analyst, and both Rational Team Concert - Developer licences to user.

	Installing the JKE Banking sample - Error.
		Timeout
		Changed admin.properties file to increase timeout from 5minutes to 100minutes.

	Installing CCM JKE Banking Sample
		Successful

	Installing QM JKE Banking Sample
		After 2 hours, Chrome closed unexpectedly.
		Restarted laptop and server.
		Error: ID CRJAZ1972E - Error fetching server status information

	Used repotools to drop QM tables - error taken care of.
	Still issue with creating JKE prject - RM and QM projects recognised as already in existance for some reason - archived whole JKE project to try again, 500 error accessing whoami service.

	Need to recreate tables I think. repotools -createTables.

	Deleted JTS, reinstalled, started steps again, will spend less time starting again than recovering the server to  useable state.

	Installed sample project again, progress screen froze but left running regardless and seems to have installed everything, to double check this is correctly installed.


Week Beginning 27/11/13

	Looking into using ReportsRESTAPI.


	ReportsRESTAPI (https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/ReportsRESTAPI#Resources_provided_by_RTC)

	Came across this on a forum - "Tip: In general, use the OSLC QM V2 API unless requiring unsupported resources." -http://sleroyblog.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/querying-rqm-40-through-oslc-and-rest-api/
	Will look into OSLC instead of Reporable API.
	Not trying to provide additional functionality on tom of the CLM, so Reportable REST should be ok for my needs. OSLC may be better supported.
	"Consumers should not rely on or remember any specific URLs, or perform 'path math' on URLs. Instead, they should use the discovery chain. All they need to know is the URL of the root services document." Always start from root services.

	Exploring Reportable REST API - https://localhost:9443/ccm/rpt/repository

	Updating class diagrams
		- Moving models under newly identified packages (i.e Build Duration under RTC instead of Jenkins)
		- Identifying useful information to hold in model for finer detail when needed:

	Starting to create domain models in Grails app
		http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/GORM.html#domainClasses

	Looking at Plain Java API for RTC
	Able to connect to repository
		Can identify project areas and display names
	Trying to access build information
	Able to access BuildResult and BuildDefinitions
		- have access to Build Durations
	Seperating this logic into a Service as recommended by the Grails best practices.
	issue with TeamPlatform.shutdown() - connection should stay open for entire life of the application

Week Beginning 4/12/13

	Refactored code in Service - seperated login, startup etc into seperate methods and added groovydoc comments for some methods.

	Trying to get a list of contributors for each ProjectArea. GetMembers returns a IContributorHandle[], trying to get an IContributor from this handle using the ITeamRepository.itemManager().fetchCompleteItems() but method will not accept the IContributorHandle[] type.

	Created method getProjectMembers(IPRojectArea) which returns all members for the project argument as a list of IContributors.

	Printed members to test view grouped by project area.

	Trying to access WorkItems under each project.
		- Code should return all workitems under each project but only returns one
			-Returns the same for each project which is correct. In the Web GUI, seems like there is more WorkItems, unsure if my understanding of a workitem is wrong or the code is wrong.

	Updating Project Status Report.

	WorkItems printed out to screen/

Week Beginning 11/12/13
	
	Checking code examples of accessing RQM - https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/RqmApi#Code_Examples.%A0

Week Beginning 18/12/13

	No Java API for RQM, REST/OSLC only.

Week Beginning 25/12/13

	Trying to understand how to traverse the REST API resources.

Week Beginning 22/01/13
	
	Returning to RTC Java API to finish more functionality here before continuing on to RQM REST inferface in order to have something properly demoable for IBM meetings 5/2/14.
	Would be nice to have the builds saving to the database, results being displayed on screen and some graphs etc. if possible. May not get all implemented in a week, but these are the goals.

	Added mapping to domain classes to override default primary key for Team and Build domains.

	Created method to get work items associated with a build result and return these as workitemimpl instead of workitemhandleimpl.

	Class structure revision Team >>1>n>> Build >>1>n>> WorkItems
	One team (Project) has many builds (BuildResult) which can contain many WorkItems. Workitems will just be used for granularity in the application, as well as for defect counting.

	Cannot cascade save Team>Build>WorkItems because of null issues. Was able to solve this on WorkItems by allowing Builds to contain nullable WorkItems.
	Set all fields to null to check behaviour - No change

	Teams are now saving correctly.

	Able to cascade delete teams.

	created domainService service, added delete and populate methods to this.

	Original implementation of primary key/foreign key and constraints were wrong. Fixed this issue. 

	Errors thrown - One WorkItem can be associated with more than one build. This violates the new constraints which makes workitem IDs be unique (id's assigned by itemId from RTC). Created many-to-many association between workItems and builds.

	Error Caused by: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space

	Key issue on Workitems, commented out code, will come back to this.

	Created table view of builds with link to delve deeper into team/project and view build information. It's probably about time I started to seperate the methods into appropriate controllers, currently just using one controller RTCTestController for everything and all views under this (currently only two views)

Week Beginning 29/01/14

	Seperated everything into seperate views and controllers (TeamController, BuildController and WorkItemController)

	Created views to display information for Teams, Buils and WorkItems. Team now displays average build for the project overall.

	Trying to get workItems to save properly, but unable to figure out why Key issues are happening, tried to create break points, but breakpoints not breaking the code as they should. Red circle for breakpoint doesn't have 'v' inside it, just empty red circle.

	Managed to get breakpoints working. Set grails.project.fork = false.

	Stepping through the code, breakpoint at if(WorkItem.get(id))

	Code breaks on newTeam.save()

	Seperated out code from populateDatabase() into 3 seperate methods populateTeams(), populateBuilds() and populateWorkItems()

	error persists. debugging.

	New error on DomainClass.get() method:

	| Error java.lang.IllegalStateException: Method on class [ibm_cd_dashboard.WorkItem] was used outside of a Grails application. If running in the context of a test using the mocking API or bootstrap Grails correctly.
	| Error 	at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)
	| Error 	at sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.java:57)
	| Error 	at sun.reflect.DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance(DelegatingConstructorAccessorImpl.java:45)
	| Error 	at java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance(Constructor.java:526)

	fixed getBuildWorkItems(IBuildResult buildResult) method to return null if no work items exist for build.

	| Error groovy.lang.MissingMethodException: No signature of method: ibm_cd_dashboard.Team.addToBuilds() is applicable for argument types: (ibm_cd_dashboard.Build) values: [ibm_cd_dashboard.Build : (unsaved)]

	The key constraint error is coming from the archived project and the current project being the same. so workitems are the same with same ID, maybe...

	Workitems added to build. Changed unique identifier to be concatination of build id and workitem id.

	Changed some things and this is not being reflected in workitems

	| Error 2014-02-03 16:05:16,948 [http-bio-8090-exec-1] ERROR util.JDBCExceptionReporter  - Referential integrity constraint violation: "FKCF0A9F832E451BAA: PUBLIC.BUILD_WORK_ITEMS FOREIGN KEY(WORK_ITEM_ID) REFERENCES PUBLIC.WORK_ITEM(WORK_ITEM_ID) ('_UukD4FfVEeOe-fhOpjWp0Q__n4XRMFfTEeOe-fhOpjWp0Q')"; SQL statement:
	insert into build_work_items (build_id, work_item_id) values (?, ?) [23506-173]

	Summary field is no longer correct. added a literal value into this for the time being, this solved the error issues.

	Couldn't drop tables. added constraints to enable proper table structure as found on Stack overflow 
	(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16869006/grom-create-needless-table-with-many-to-many-mapping)
	(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4131174/how-do-i-override-the-cascade-delete-for-a-relation-in-grails-gorm)

	Work Items no longer being saved.

Week Beginning 05/02/14

	45 WorkItems should be associated with each project. only 14 being associated with one project and 0 witht he other.

	45 workItems being saved to the database. on the second loop.

	45 workItems asigned to builds. miscalculation in workItems count!!!!

	Question on forum https://jazz.net/forum/questions/141572/get-all-work-items-for-a-build-result

	Reply to answer on jazz.net. Went to try implement it, but all my virtual machines are missing. error -102(File not Found)

	Reinstalled IBM VM and RTC server. Installed JKE Banking sample again. 

Week Beginning 12/02/14

	Creating sitemesh templates for the site to include IBM style.

	Created "common" module for css, this will combine all required css into one file and compress automatically optimising the imports.

	Able to get CSS working. adding appropriate classes to existing views.

Week Beginning 19/2/14
	
	To try verify workitem count in the GUI compared to what's returned and email brendan asking for help, recommended by Gary and John.

	Total work Items should be 89. 
	There should be 34 defects. 
	24 of these shoudl be Tasks.
	25 Stories
	2 Track Build Items
	2 Impediments

    Researching how to integrate Jenkins with RTC.
    Installed github plugin to jenkins for auce demo install
    https://saucelabs.com/jenkins/4

    Managed to pass Groovy object into View and manipulate with Javascript. put values of Groovy object into two 1D arrays, with corresponding indexes.
    Used a map to pass details into D3.js using the nv.d3.js models to create a line chart of the build times in order of modified date. Added another row to table of builds to have build number which is references in the line graph on the x axis.

	 Changed default page to load the TeamController/checkState action.

	 Implementing logging in the application.
	 Log files creating, but empty.
	 Adding logging for exceptions etc.

	 Changed server back to basic form authentication for REST access for RQM

	Going to change code logic to check if domain has any teams, if not, populate teams, if it has teams but they have not been modified in some time period, check the server for additional information, otherwise, load the index page. 

	Researching Quartz for AJAX type request to the server.
	Installed grails quartz plugin
	 - create-job script not there
	 needed to issue command grails refresh-dependencies - create-job script now available.

	 Created methods and variables to hold and set DomainLastModified and ServerLastModified, check whether DomainLastModified < ServerLastModified to see if Domain is up to date, can add this to a quartz job to check priodically.

	 Added Quartz job to run eevery 2 hours. need to implement method in service to be called by this Job to actually check the server. Method stub in DomainServer for this.

Week Beginning 05/03/14

	Looking at unit testing application.
	JUnit vs Spock.
	Junit s

	Groovy Mock, Gmock, EasyMock, JMock, Mockito.
	Jazz forum recommends Mockito, this is what IBM use internally.

	Using Mockito external jar I get error:
		| Error Compilation error compiling [unit] tests: startup failed:
		/Users/shanemurphy/IBM-CD-Dashboard/IBM_CD_Dashboard/test/unit/ibm_cd_dashboard/DomainServiceSpec.groovy: 5: unable to resolve class org.mockito.Mockito

	   	import org.mockito.Mockito
	   	^

		1 error
	 	(Use --stacktrace to see the full trace)

	 Needed to ad to lib folder aswell as import as external library.

	 Error on the .when() method of Mockito:

	Reply from Brendan - Spock is not approved for use in IBM - use JUnit.

	IBM Meeting - Yellow status. Issues surrounding the workitems is an internal issue and outside of the scope of the project - don't know how to resolve, move on. The main point of the project is the GUI, should concentrate on providing mock data, showing an understanding of how the data would be collected from the server, but not actually having to fetch from the server. Focus on User Stories of user roles and providing different views to different users. Focus on bringing more information on first page and only delve deeper where really nessecary. Should be able to get all information required at a glance.

	Created user and role domain. Following tutorial - http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/docs/manual/guide/single.html#tutorials
	
	Can now login and logout, changed logout to accept GET requests. To implement profile editing page next where user can select projects from all projects in the database to associate with their profile.

Week Beginning 19/3/14
	
	Adding userprofile to user domain

	User Profile linked, edit page lists current teams/projects with a checkbox beside them. If the team/project is listed in the users profile list of projects, the checkbox will be ticked already, showing it has already been selected.
	Problem at the minute - UserProfile doesn't persist.

	Seperate issue:

	Bootstrapped meaningless data into current domain objects using random integers etc. All working. Only RTC methods not being called so only bootstrap data showing.
	Got around this by calling populateTeams() method from bootstrap.

	Seperated info in main index (TeamController) nested in table into partial view _teamData

	UserProfile Issue resolved. now persisting. cannot store Lists in domains as you might expect the be able to.
	List<String> projects 
		changed to
	List projects
	static hasMany = [projects:String]
