	Created Technical Architecture document

	Emailed Brendan with Logical Architecture document and questions relating to what data is relevant to and needs to be stored from each summary data to enable greater levels of granularity.

	Created Class Diagrams

	Updated Project Status Report slides

Week Beginning 13/11/13

	Brendan provided additional information regarding summary metrics:
		Build Duration - from RTC
		Manual testing Duration - Test Case Executions Records
		API Test Coverage - TBD - We don't know how API Test Coverage will be
		tracked. RQM would represent a tick box exercise
		time from final code submission to production (cloud and on-premises) -
		Jenkins will drive the commit but UrbanDeploy or CHEF will do the
		deployment.  How long it takes to execute the pipeline.  Jenkins.
		Defects opened per capita - RTC Query for Defects
		Cumulative open+deferred defects - RTC Query

	Jazz Server/RTC/RQM not available for Mac OS X. Installing Ubuntu 13.10 via VirtualBox to install Jazz Server etc. through Linux. Will need to access this through the Virtual Box using NAT (Chapter 6 of VirtualBox guide)

	Installed Jazz Team Server
		-Change and Configuration Management
		-Quality Management
		-Requirements Management
		-Lifecycle Project Administration

	Configured NAT and Port Forwarding for virtual machine
		-Can now access JTS from Host OS using localhost:9443 or localhost:9080

	Installing the JKE Banking sample project
		This sample provides an in-flight perspective of the collaborations that occur on a typical Agile team. Walk through an iteration with the team as they deliver a new feature to support an important corporate initiative called Money that Matters. To learn more about the Money that Matters sample.

			Needed to assign Enterprise Developer licence to my user as per - https://jazz.net/forum/questions/95134/unable-to-create-jke-in-401

		Sample Project installed
		(((/Images/Installing Sample Project.jpg)))

		Sample JKE Project has no data in it, need to drop and recreate.
		Added lib dependencies to grails app.
		
		RTC Server appears to start in the logs, sometimes it is accessible from the weblink, sometimes not. Server requests 4GB of memory at startup laptop currently only has 4GB or RAM memory installed (Will upgrade), changed 
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xmx4G"
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms4G"
		in server.startup file to
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xmx2G"
			JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Xms2G"
		This has no effect, the server still will not startup. - Big Roadblock - emailed Brendan.

Week Beginning 19/11/13
	Ordered additional (16GB) RAM for laptop

	Uninstalled Jenkins - uses a lot of RAM in the background even with no jobs.

	Uninstalled RTC Server and reinstalled. Working fine now, waiting for RAM to arrive before attempting to install the sample project.

	Working with Site Template - Added Title and Nav bar components as per the IBM OneUI Template. Linked in CSS files and file structure - CSS not being utilised.

	Installed RTC Server on desktop computer on home network. Installed Sample Projects, Error, but looks as if all is there, will suffice until additional RAM arrives and can install locally on virtualbox. Can access this now through my local network at home.

Week Beginning 27/11/13
	
	Connecting to JTS I get:
		Error 500: Internal Server Error
		URI
		/IBM_CD_Dashboard/rtcTest/index
		Class
		org.xml.sax.SAXParseException
		Message
		The reference to entity "etag" must end with the ';' delimiter.
	Seems to be related to basic and form authentication

	Changing Tomcat authentication from FORM to BASIC as per - https://jazz.net/forum/questions/100510/jazz-authentication-change-from-form-to-basic-on-tomacat

	Form returned with 200 success code now.

	Printing the returned XML from /ccm/oslc/workitems/catalog to screen produces one string "Project Areas" - need to install sample project JKE Banking on Virtual Machine JTS Server.

	Installing the JKE Banking sample - Error.
		Licence issue.
		Assigned Rational Quality Manager - Quality Professional, Rational Requirements Composer - Analyst, and both Rational Team Concert - Developer licences to user.

	Installing the JKE Banking sample - Error.
		Timeout
		Changed admin.properties file to increase timeout from 5minutes to 100minutes.

	Installing CCM JKE Banking Sample
		Successful

	Installing QM JKE Banking Sample
		After 2 hours, Chrome closed unexpectedly.
		Restarted laptop and server.
		Error: ID CRJAZ1972E - Error fetching server status information

	Used repotools to drop QM tables - error taken care of.
	Still issue with creating JKE prject - RM and QM projects recognised as already in existance for some reason - archived whole JKE project to try again, 500 error accessing whoami service.

	Need to recreate tables I think. repotools -createTables.

	Deleted JTS, reinstalled, started steps again, will spend less time starting again than recovering the server to  useable state.

	Installed sample project again, progress screen froze but left running regardless and seems to have installed everything, to double check this is correctly installed.


Week Beginning 27/11/13

	Looking into using ReportsRESTAPI.


	ReportsRESTAPI (https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/ReportsRESTAPI#Resources_provided_by_RTC)

	Build Duration 				Minutes        		RTC 				buildResult (type: com.ibm.team.build.BuildResult)

																		https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/ReportsRESTAPI#build
	                                                 
	SPRs opened per capita     											workItem (com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItemType)

																			in a repository.

	Cumulative open+deferred   											workItem (com.ibm.team.workitem.State)
	defects (technical debt)     Number				RTC 				group (type: xs:string). The "State Group" of this state. A 
																		state group is a process-independent grouping of states, which is useful for creating reports which are not dependent on a particular process but still need to know, for example, whether work items are open or closed. Every state belongs to one of the following state groups: "OPEN_STATES", "CLOSED_STATES", "IN_PROGRESS_STATES".

	Came across this on a forum - "Tip: In general, use the OSLC QM V2 API unless requiring unsupported resources." -http://sleroyblog.wordpress.com/2013/04/09/querying-rqm-40-through-oslc-and-rest-api/
	Will look into OSLC instead of Reporable API.
	Not trying to provide additional functionality on tom of the CLM, so Reportable REST should be ok for my needs. OSLC may be better supported.
	"Consumers should not rely on or remember any specific URLs, or perform 'path math' on URLs. Instead, they should use the discovery chain. All they need to know is the URL of the root services document." Always start from root services.

	Exploring Reportable REST API - https://localhost:9443/ccm/rpt/repository

	Updating class diagrams
		- Moving models under newly identified packages (i.e Build Duration under RTC instead of Jenkins)
		- Identifying useful information to hold in model for finer detail when needed:

	Starting to create domain models in Grails app
		http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/GORM.html#domainClasses

	Looking at Plain Java API for RTC
	Able to connect to repository
		Can identify project areas and display names
	Trying to access build information
	Able to access BuildResult and BuildDefinitions
		- have access to Build Durations
	Seperating this logic into a Service as recommended by the Grails best practices.
	issue with TeamPlatform.shutdown() - connection should stay open for entire life of the application

Week Beginning 4/12/13

	Refactored code in Service - seperated login, startup etc into seperate methods and added groovydoc comments for some methods.

	Trying to get a list of contributors for each ProjectArea. GetMembers returns a IContributorHandle[], trying to get an IContributor from this handle using the ITeamRepository.itemManager().fetchCompleteItems() but method will not accept the IContributorHandle[] type.
